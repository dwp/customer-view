                        <p>We tested two homepage designs in a Citizen Me user research study, including:</p>
                        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                        <p>We completed this design in sprint 26 and the survey ran in sprint 31. The outcomes of user research suggested the list design was more user friendly.</p>
