        Accessibility statement for Manage your benefits and State Pension
      </h1>

      <p>This service is part of the wider GOV.UK website. There’s a separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility-statement">accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

      <p>This statement is for the Manage your benefits and State Pension service, available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-benefits-and-state-pension.service.dwp.gov.uk/">manage-benefits-and-state-pension.service.dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <p>It is also for its connected services, which are:</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this service</h2>

      <p>This service is run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to: </p>

        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate all the service using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to all the service using a screen reader</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this service is</h2>

      <p>The service is using common styles, patterns and components from the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK Design System</a> which are widely regarded as accessible.</p>

      <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>MacOS VoiceOver cannot read out content within bulleted lists</li>
        <li>Mac OS VoiceOver uses inconsistent names for the footer across the service</li>
        <li>After a 20 minutes of inactivity, users will not get a warning before the service times out</li>
        <li>There are multiple headings with an H1 tag on the timeout page</li>
        <li>When a user signs out of the service, they go to a loading page which automatically redirect them to a sign out page. The automatic redirect does not give the user a warning, they cannot adjust the timing, and it is an interruption and change of context without the user’s request</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We are continuously improving and reviewing the service and intend to make this service fully accessible.</p>

      <p>There are other issues when a user signs out of the service. They are taken to loading page which automatically redirect them to a sign out page.
