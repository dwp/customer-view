      We need to check your identity
    </h1>
    <p>This helps us protect against fraud and keep you secure.</p>
    <p>To complete the identity check, you will need to answer some questions about your personal details and income from work or benefits.</p>
    <p>It can help to have some documents to hand, such as:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a payslip from the last 3 months</li>
        <li>information about housing benefit, if you claim it</li>
      </ul>
