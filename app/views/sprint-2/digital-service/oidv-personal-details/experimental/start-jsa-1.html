            <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Confirm your identity</h1>

            <p>Confirming your identity helps us check it is really you making a claim â€“ not someone pretending to be you. You will need to register and answer some questions about yourself.</p>

              <a href="/auth/dev-ready/sign-in">Sign in if you have already registered</a>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
            <p>To register, you will need:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>an email address</li>
                <li>a mobile phone</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You will also need information from 2 sources. You can choose from:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a valid UK passport</li>
                <li>payslips or P60</li>
                <li>Self Assessment</li>
                <li>information about tax credits, if you claim them</li>
                <li>details of your bank accounts, loans, mortgages or credit agreements</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6"><a href="">I do not have this information</a></p>

            <!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
            <p>We will send security codes to your email and mobile phone to check that they belong to you.</p>
            <p>You will create a password, which you will use with your email address to sign in securely.</p>
            <p>We will ask some questions to check we are dealing with the right person and to protect you against fraud. We will then check this information against our records.</p>
            <p>Each time you sign in we will send a new security code to your mobile phone.</p> -->
